- add new column from IA data and compute
- add full member meta info, including plenary stuff
- use exact dates, not months
- make "by day" function, maybe
- degree, membership, other connectednesses
- overall connectedness measure and "leave one out" breaking effect
- events be persistent, retain old version too
